Report Item 1:


Report Item 2:

Since there are 12 points in the vector, there are 11 gaps between adjacent elements;thus the delta between them should be 1/11, as the the vector starts from 0 to 1. In general, the delta of a equal-spaced vector with size N that starts from a to b should be (b-a)/(N-1)
